# graph-to-keyframes generator
Draw a graph in d3.js and have it converted to a css keyframes animation


## Goal
Use this tool to draw an 'animation graph' (following Amit Sheen's lessons on sketching the end result animation in the form of a graph first), and have it converted to css keyframes automatically.
